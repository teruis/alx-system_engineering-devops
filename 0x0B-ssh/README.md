# Project: 0x0B. SSH | ALX Africa Intranet

## Overview

Welcome to the 0x0B. SSH project! This project is part of the ALX Africa Intranet curriculum and focuses on developing your skills in DevOps, SSH, Network, SysAdmin, and Security.

## Background Context

In this project, you'll be working with an Ubuntu server located in a distant data center. Unlike the previous level, you'll connect to the server using SSH with an RSA key instead of a password. The server has been configured with the public key generated in a previous project, and you can find the server information in the "My Servers" section of the intranet.

### Resources

Before you begin, make sure to review the following resources:
- [What is a (physical) server - text](<link>)
- [What is a (physical) server - video](<link>)
- [SSH essentials](<link>)
- [SSH Config File](<link>)
- [Public Key Authentication for SSH](<link>)
- [How Secure Shell Works](<link>)
- [SSH Crash Course](<link>) (Watch this if configuring SSH is still confusing. It may be helpful to watch at x1.25 speed or above.)

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain what a server is and where servers usually live.
- Understand the concept of SSH.
- Create an SSH RSA key pair.
- Connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair.
- Know the advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`.
